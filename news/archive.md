### Biden and Trump Oversee Covert Operation in Atlanta

December 21, 2024 - The Creator says both President Joe 
Biden and 
President-elect Donald J. Trump are at the Welcome House, 234 Memorial Drive SW, Atlanta, Georgia, overseeing renewed attempts to kill one of the Creator’s two servants residing there. The operation is cloaked in secrecy, with Biden, Trump, and their Secret Service teams utilizing advanced microwave cloaking technology to remain nearly undetectable to the naked eye.

Earlier on Saturday morning, between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m., Trump reportedly spent several hours at the Red Roof Inn on North Druid Hills Road, where multiple attempts to kill His servant were made. His servant had been lured to the hotel under the guise of socializing with a new acquaintance and their "friends," later identified by the Creator as Secret Service agents. Despite the efforts, the Creator’s servant remains unharmed and unconcerned, though admittedly annoyed. Both leaders continue to collaborate in this escalating situation.

### TAG's Orchestrators Plan Devastating Escalation: The Mother Of All Bombs Over Southwest Atlanta
After realizing that their objectives were failing due to the Creator's protection of His servant and the work being performed, the delegation held a series of meetings. They concluded with a decision to have the CIA deploy a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), commonly referred to as the "Mother Of All Bombs," over Phoenix House in the Capitol View neighborhood of Atlanta. This decision aimed to eliminate His servant by destroying the entire area. Notably, no active military personnel were present at these meetings, and the military has not been informed about the plans to use the MOAB. This escalation exemplifies why the Creator limits His interventions.

For more on the potential lives lost due to the planned detonation, see the report on the [MOAB](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/MOAB).

This is foretold by the Creator in the Book of Revelation,

### **Trump Still Refuses to Legally Refute ANY StopTAG Reporting** - December 7, 2024
Our report delves into the critical role of President-elect Donald J. Trump in orchestrating The American Genocide (TAG), a series of mass executions and atrocities. Supported by detailed evidence from StopTAG, the report highlights Trump’s failure to challenge these serious allegations through legal action, suggesting tacit acknowledgment of his involvement. Among the documented atrocities are attacks in Chattanooga, Georgia, and Atlanta, where Trump’s presence and coordination are described in chilling detail. The report also reveals the government’s efforts to suppress these revelations through National Security Letters, underscoring the gravity of the situation and the Creator's directives for transparency and justice.

### **Biden Comes to Trump's Aid in Atlanta** - December 7, 2024
President Biden made a discreet trip to Atlanta on Friday night, December 6, 2024, arriving at the Welcome House permanent supportive housing facility around 11 p.m. at the request of President-Elect Trump. This visit was part of their ongoing attempts to eliminate one of the Creator's two servants. President Biden remains in Atlanta at the time of this writing.  

The Welcome House, where one of the Creator's two servants currently resides, is a permanent supportive housing facility. His servant was relocated there following a previous orchestration that ended with one perpetrator murdering another in His servant’s apartment. In preparation for Biden’s arrival, residents of the Welcome House were removed for physical and operational security purposes. The latter ensured that no one overheard anything discussed during the operation.  

To provide coverage from an elevated point, the Secret Service utilized an Atlanta Fire Department truck stationed in the middle of Memorial Drive. During a previous visit, they used a Greyhound Bus stopped in the same location. The Secret Service also employed microwave cloaking technology, rendering their parked motorcade and personnel—including the President, President-Elect, and their protectees—nearly invisible. Interestingly, neither Biden nor Trump are utilizing the typical Suburbans or "The Beast" limousine; instead, they are using modified Mercedes-Benz Sprinters.  

Despite numerous physical attempts to harm one of the Creator’s two servants, these operations have failed. As a result, the orchestrators have intensified subconscious mind manipulation tactics in an attempt to induce physical harm indirectly. Financial restrictions remain in place, effectively implementing a “starvation protocol.”  

His servant residing at Welcome House remains steadfast and confident in the Creator's protection. While these orchestrations are an annoyance, His servant perceives no genuine threat to his life. His primary concern is the potential for new orchestrations involving Hickory Valley Christian Church, given the proximity of both Biden and Trump to the church.  

His servant has extended an invitation for direct dialogue with the orchestrators, highlighting the undeniable interventions by the Creator in these matters.  

Further updates will be shared as developments unfold.

### **Trump Returns to Atlanta** - November 30, 2024
U.S. President-Elect Donald J. Trump secretly returned to Atlanta late on Friday night, November 29, 2024, and went to the Welcome House to oversee continued efforts by both the current and incoming administrations to eliminate one or both of the Creator's servants and to obtain the access device containing credentials for updating the StopTAG organization's repositories on GitHub. This visit follows his recent trips on November 12 and 26. One of the Creator's servants, who remains unharmed and unconcerned for his safety, was relocated to the Welcome House at 234 Memorial Drive by the CIA after an earlier attempt on November 18, during which one perpetrator was killed by another inside His servant's apartment. The Creator's servant continues to reside at the Welcome House as of this writing, securely retaining possession of the access device and expressing no concern for its safety or the safety of His servants.

### **Members of Trump's Transition Team Witness Murder – November 18, 2024**
In a shocking turn of events, several members of Trump's transition team, who had stayed behind in Atlanta to facilitate the theft of a mobile device crucial to updating StopTAG, became eyewitnesses to a murder. During an operation aimed at seizing the device and eliminating the Creator's servant, a violent argument broke out between the perpetrators, resulting in one person fatally stabbing another. The perpetrators had been sent to target the Creator's servant and acquire the device.

Despite being invisible to the naked eye due to their use of microwave cloaking technology, the witnesses remained in the apartment as the crime scene was investigated. They did not come forward to the authorities. The Atlanta Police Department has arrested the individual responsible for the murder and charged him with the crime. The Creator's servant, who was unharmed, has fully cooperated with law enforcement. He continues to hold possession of the access device and other critical evidence. For his safety, the Creator's servant has been relocated to a new facility, Welcome House, where he remains under 24/7 surveillance.
