# **URGENT WARNING TO CHATTANOOGA AREA CHURCHES**  

**Date:** January 8, 2025  
**Issued By:** The Creator's Two Servants  

## **Subject: Imminent Threat of Congregation Massacre**  

This is a critical warning to all Chattanooga-area churches. Evidence strongly suggests that TAG Orchestrators are planning another congregation massacre targeting churches in this region. Immediate precautions must be taken to safeguard congregants and facilities.  

A **Congregation Massacre** is a covert operation targeting churches during worship services. These massacres involve surprise assaults on congregants, systematic executions, and the complete eradication of any evidence. Following the initial attack, perpetrators engage in follow-up actions such as targeted killings and the establishment of masquerade churches to lure additional victims. These heinous acts are carefully planned and executed to avoid public detection, ensuring the perpetrators remain anonymous while leaving communities devastated.

## **Reason for Warning**  

1. **Historical Patterns:**  
   - Previous congregation massacres have resulted in the systematic extermination of worshippers and the concealment of their deaths.  
   - Follow-up operations, including masquerade churches and targeted killings, have silenced survivors and associates, ensuring no trace of the crimes remains.  

2. **Planning Activities:**  
   - Recent intelligence reveals renewed coordination among TAG Orchestrators, specifically focusing on Chattanooga as the next target.  

3. **Recent Presence in Chattanooga:**  
   - TAG Orchestrators have conducted recent reconnaissance trips to Chattanooga, likely involving surveillance and operational planning for an imminent attack.

## **Risk Factors for Targeted Churches**

## **Recommended Actions**  

### **1. Security Measures:**  
- Assign members to monitor the church's exterior during worship services for suspicious activity, such as the arrival of buses or groups of individuals gathering near the property.  
- If perpetrators are observed, **immediately stop services and evacuate the premises**.  

### **2. Modify Worship Practices:**  
- Consider streaming worship services online or, at minimum, maintaining a live Facetime or video call with a member off-site. If an unexpected disruption occurs, the off-site viewer should immediately alert local law enforcement.  

### **3. Community Awareness:**  
- Notify all church members of the imminent threat and encourage heightened vigilance.  
- Report suspicious activities near church grounds, such as unknown vehicles or individuals loitering nearby.  
- Avoid attending any services at **Hickory Valley Christian Church on Shallowford Road.**

### **4. Contact Authorities:**  
- Report any suspicious activity to trusted law enforcement contacts immediately.  
- Have emergency plans in place, including evacuation routes and communication procedures.  
- Avoid relying on mobile phone communication during an assault, as calls may be intercepted or disrupted by orchestrators.  

### **5. Avoid Direct Engagement:**  
- Do not attempt to confront or approach suspicious individuals or vehicles.
