**Date:** January 8, 2025  
**Issued By:** The Creator's two servants  
**Effective Date:** January 12, 2025

## **Subject: Imminent Threat of Congregation Massacre**  

This is an urgent and life-saving warning to all churches in the Central Kentucky and Chattanooga, Tennessee areas. Evidence strongly indicates that TAG Orchestrators are planning another wave of congregation massacres targeting churches in these regions on January 12, 2025. Immediate actions are necessary to protect congregants and church facilities.  

### **What is a Congregation Massacre?**  
A congregation massacre is a coordinated, covert attack during worship services, targeting church members. These assaults involve:  
- Surprise attacks during services.  
- Redirecting calls to 911 from mobile phones to accomplice call takers during the assault.  
- Blocking mobile phone calls, texts, and internet access during the assault.  
- Systematic executions and evidence destruction.  
- Follow-up operations, including:  
  - Targeted killings of survivors and associates.  
  - Establishment of "masquerade churches" to lure additional victims.  

#### Churches that suffered a congregation massacre:  
- **Mount Calvary Baptist Church** (Lexington, KY - April 2, 2023) – 127 victims.  
- **Lexington Bethel Baptist Church** (Lexington, KY - May 2023) – 250 victims.  
- **House of God (Georgetown Street)** (Lexington, KY - May 2023) – 300 victims.  
- **House of God (Broadway)** (Lexington, KY - May 2023) – 300 victims.  
- **Mount Zion Baptist Church** (Georgetown, KY - June 2023) – 166 victims.

- **Hickory Valley Christian Church** (Chattanooga, TN - May 12, 2024) – 1,000 victims.  

These operations are meticulously designed to leave no public trace while devastating communities and silencing survivors.

## **Why This Warning is Being Issued**  

1. **Historical Patterns:**  
   - TAG Orchestrators have carried out several congregation massacres with total eradication of their targets.  
   - Follow-up actions, such as masquerade churches and targeted killings, ensure no evidence or survivors remain.  
   - Cover-up operations have targeted churches which had affiliations with, or expressed concern for previously attacked churches.  

---

## **Risk Factors**  

Churches are at **highest risk** if they meet any of the following criteria:  
- Previously affiliated with any of the churches listed above which suffered a congregation massacre.  
- Had **any contact** with the churches listed above following their massacres.

## **911 During a Congregation Massacre**  

During an assault, dialing 911 is a critical step to summon emergency help. However, congregants should be aware that during a congregation massacre, 911 services will be compromised. Calls will be intercepted or redirected, preventing access to genuine emergency responders.  

**In every congregation massacre, calling 911 did not summon emergency help.**  

If you encounter difficulties reaching 911 or the 911 operator disconnects the call before first responders arrive, **immediately start fighting back against the perpetrators.**  

---

## **Protective Measures**  

### 1. Plan to EVACUATE!  
- Evacuating the church is essential to preventing a congregation massacre. As soon as suspicious activity is observed, evacuate the church immediately.  

### 2. Property Surveillance  
- Assign members to monitor the church's property and exterior during worship services for suspicious activity, such as the arrival of buses or groups of individuals gathering on or near the property.  
- Lock or monitor lesser-used exterior doors.  
- Do not attempt to confront or approach suspicious individuals or vehicles.  

### 3. Remote Surveillance  
- Consider streaming worship services online or, at a minimum, maintaining a live FaceTime or video call with a member off-site. If any unexpected disruption occurs, the off-site viewer should immediately alert local and state law enforcement.  

### 4. Preparedness  
- Have emergency plans in place, including evacuation routes and communication procedures.  
- Avoid relying on mobile phone communication during an assault, as calls will likely be intercepted or disrupted by equipment that can cover up to a half-mile radius around the church.  
- Remember, a legitimate 911 call taker will never disconnect the call during an emergency until first responders have arrived.  

### 5. Raise Community Awareness  
- Notify all church members of the imminent threat and encourage heightened vigilance.  
- Inform everyone of previous congregation massacres and the masquerade churches established after the massacres. Avoid visiting or attending any services at these listed churches.  
- Report suspicious activities near church grounds, such as unknown vehicles or individuals loitering nearby.  

### 6. Fight Back!  
- Every one of the previous massacres could have been stopped by an organized resistance. Fighting back is encouraged during an assault.  

### 7. Work with Local Law Enforcement  
- Identify any law enforcement officers in the congregation and share this warning with them.  
- Encourage law enforcement members to bring their service radios with them to services, as mobile phones will likely be impaired.  
- Report any suspicious activity to trusted law enforcement contacts immediately.
