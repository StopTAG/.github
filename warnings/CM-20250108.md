**Issued By:** The Creator's two servants  

## **Subject: Imminent Threat of Congregation Massacre**  

This is an urgent and life-saving warning to all churches in the Chattanooga and Central Kentucky areas. Evidence strongly indicates that TAG Orchestrators are planning another wave of congregation massacres targeting churches in these regions. Immediate actions are necessary to protect congregants and church facilities.  

### **What is a Congregation Massacre?**  
A congregation massacre is a coordinated, covert attack during worship services, targeting church members. These assaults involve:  
- Surprise attacks during services.  
- Systematic executions and evidence destruction.  
- Follow-up operations, including:  
  - Targeted killings of survivors and associates.  
  - Establishment of "masquerade churches" to lure additional victims.  

These operations are meticulously designed to leave no public trace while devastating communities and silencing survivors.

## **Recommended Precautions**  

### **1. Strengthen Security:**  
- Assign members to monitor the church exterior during services for suspicious activity (e.g., unknown vehicles, buses, or groups gathering).  
- If perpetrators are observed, **immediately halt services and evacuate the premises**.  

### **2. Stream Worship Services:**  
- Maintain a live video connection with someone off-site during in-person services. In the event of a disruption, the off-site participant should immediately contact law enforcement.  

### **3. Increase Awareness:**  
- Inform all members of your congregation about this imminent threat.  
- Report any suspicious activity near your church, such as unfamiliar vehicles or individuals loitering.  
- Avoid attending services at **Hickory Valley Christian Church** on Shallowford Road or any other previously targeted churches.  

### **4. Coordinate with Authorities:**  
- Report any suspicious activity to trusted law enforcement immediately.  
- Develop comprehensive emergency plans, including evacuation routes and alternative communication methods.  
- Avoid relying on mobile phones during an assault; communications may be intercepted or disrupted.  

### **5. Avoid Confrontation:**  
- Do not confront or approach suspicious individuals or vehicles. Your priority should be the safety of your congregation.
