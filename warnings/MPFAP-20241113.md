**URGENT WARNING FOR INDIVIDUALS MISSING LOVED ONES FROM FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN CENTRAL KENTUCKY AND THE TENNESSEE VALLEY**

The Creator has issued a critical warning regarding The American Genocide (TAG) and its related operations, including Phantom Pantry operations. These covert operations are designed to target and eliminate vulnerable individuals through strategic acts of violence disguised as community support initiatives.

### TAG and Phantom Pantry Operations

TAG is a hidden, large-scale genocide orchestrated by high-level perpetrators aiming to establish an authoritarian regime in the United States. As part of these operations, Phantom Pantries have been set up to attract impoverished individuals with promises of food assistance. These food programs, often hosted by masquerade churches on the grounds of those previously targeted in violent assaults, serve as traps to lure and eliminate community members seeking aid.

Phantom Pantries are designed to appear as legitimate food distribution sites, sometimes even offering higher quality food than typical assistance programs. However, the food distributed is often unsafe and potentially lethal. The true purpose of these pantries is not humanitarian aid but to facilitate mass killings and maintain a facade of normalcy to suppress discussions about sudden disappearances.

### Targeted Killings of Those Filing Missing Persons Reports

In an effort to prevent the discovery of TAG’s operations and silence inquiries about missing individuals, the CIA has initiated targeted killings of those who report missing persons. This practice began immediately following the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in April 2023.

**How the Targeting Occurs:**

- Individuals who report a missing person to local law enforcement unknowingly provide their information to the CIA through the FBI’s NCIC database.
- Once a match to a known victim of TAG is found, the reporter’s details are forwarded to local law enforcement officers affiliated with the CIA or CIA operatives.
- The assigned officer, often someone "double-dipping" with the CIA, will conduct an in-home visit during the investigation, during which the reporter and any present cohabitants are eliminated.
- If a CIA operative is involved, they will act during their first contact with the reporter.

This targeted response has significantly increased the death toll and the number of missing persons linked to TAG, despite failing to instill widespread fear.

### Recommended Actions

**The Creator’s guidance for those with missing loved ones is as follows:**

1. **Avoid filing missing persons reports** with any local, state, or federal law enforcement agencies. Doing so may put you at risk of targeted elimination.
2. **Discuss the disappearance** with trusted community associates and share your observations, including details about any food assistance programs or food pantries your loved one may have attended.
3. **Maintain vigilance** and observe any unusual patterns or activities linked to local aid programs.

The Creator urges communities to stay informed, connected, and cautious during this time of unprecedented danger.
