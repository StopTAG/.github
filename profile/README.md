## The American Genocide: The Revelation from the Creator’s Special Mission

The Creator has revealed that TAG, *The American Genocide*, is, in fact, a genocide—though hidden from plain sight. Driven by authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints, this atrocity has been growing as an undercurrent in society. The only way to end this hidden genocide is through direct intervention by the Creator. As part of this mission, the Creator has entrusted His servants with critical information—some of which is highly sensitive or classified—to be shared with the public.

###  About TAG

The American Genocide (TAG) began in response to the introduction of Spark, a groundbreaking product designed by the Creator to restore the human immune system, combat cancer, and strengthen the cardiovascular system. Spark promised to end chronic diseases and revolutionize healthcare. The existence of Spark came to light when a routine blood test of an HIV-positive patient, Ken, showed no trace of HIV, a result confirmed by the U.S. government. This discovery alarmed pharmaceutical companies like Gilead Sciences, which saw Spark as a direct threat to their profits and initiated a covert campaign to eliminate its influence. This campaign led to targeted killings of Kelvin Williams' associates, destruction of churches, and systematic violence against communities such as Jessamine County, Kentucky; Kanawha County, West Virginia; and Maury County, Tennessee.

Attacks on churches, like Mount Calvary Baptist Church, followed by six additional churches, marked a shift from corporate interests to an authoritarian agenda driven by political elites. The acts were deemed necessary to establish an authoritarian regime in the United States with Donald J. Trump as the supreme leader. The perpetrators have engaged in continued acts of violence, using commandeered churches holding funerals and food pantries solely to kill anyone who comes.

## The American Genocide: Church Attacks

The perpetrators of The American Genocide started attacking seated congregations in churches during their weekly worship hour. Each attack follows the tactics described in "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen's book *Surprise, Kill, Vanish*, which details sudden, high-intensity assaults, execution-style killings, and the careful disposal of evidence to erase all traces of the violence. These tactics illustrate the dark capabilities of covert operations designed to silence perceived threats and obliterate evidence of their existence.

## The Creator

The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the Creator of both Life and the Universe, the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. The Creator mentioned herein is the same entity referred to in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs.
