## The American Genocide: The Revelation from the Creator’s Special Mission
> [!WARNING]
> November 26, 2024 - [Phantom Pantry](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Phantom-Pantry) operations likely ongoing at Hickory Valley Christian Church (Chattanooga, TN) and Mount Zion Baptist Church (Georgetown, KY).  Anyone visiting these churches seeking assistance will be killed. 

## About The American Genocide 
The American Genocide is a covert and devastating campaign initiated in response to [Spark](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Spark)—a gift from the Creator  that restores the human immune system to His designed function, allowing it to eliminate any disease not caused by organ failure or dysfunction. Spark's emergence threatened pharmaceutical companies' profits, leading Gilead Sciences and the CIA to launch a brutal campaign against those associated with Spark.

Former President Donald J. Trump was aware of the initial operations to eliminate associates of the Creator's servant and continued to be consulted about subsequent attacks. This included a series of church assaults, where congregations were targeted during their worship services. These attacks were aimed at eliminating believers, who were viewed as threats to the establishment of authoritarian rule. This hidden genocide represents a dark chapter in modern history. Explore this portal to understand the full scope and impact of TAG.

[The Creator](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator) has revealed that TAG, *The American Genocide*, is, in fact, a genocide—though hidden from plain sight. Driven by authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints, this atrocity has been growing as an undercurrent in society. The only way to end this hidden genocide is through direct intervention by the Creator. As part of [His special mission](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator#the-creators-missions), the Creator has entrusted His servants with critical information—some of which is highly sensitive or classified—to be shared with the public.

The Creator wants everyone to know that He is fully aware of the situation, and [the Apocalypse is already in progress](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Revelation). It consists of both symbolic upheavals, with literal seismic earthquakes expected to start soon. Proof of this is reflected in the [classified mission](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Presidential-Mission) involving Presidents Biden and Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and CIA Director William Burns to [Phoenix House](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Phoenix-House) in Atlanta, where they oversaw the repeated attempts to kill one of the Creator's two servants on August 29, 2024. Some members of the delegation remained in Atlanta as of now.

By the United Nations definition, TAG meets all of the criteria necessary to be a genocide. See [TAG: By Definition, A Genocide](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/TAGDEF).

## About The Creator
The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. The Creator mentioned here is the same entity referenced in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike. [Read more.](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator)

## Latest TAG News
### **Trump Returns to Atlanta** - November 30, 2024
U.S. President-Elect Donald J. Trump secretly returned to Atlanta late on Friday night, November 29, 2024, and went to the Welcome House to oversee continued efforts by both the current and incoming administrations to eliminate one or both of the Creator's servants and to obtain the access device containing credentials for updating the StopTAG organization's repositories on GitHub. This visit follows his recent trips on November 12 and 26. One of the Creator's servants, who remains unharmed and unconcerned for his safety, was relocated to the Welcome House at 234 Memorial Drive by the CIA after an earlier attempt on November 18, during which one perpetrator was killed by another inside His servant's apartment. The Creator's servant continues to reside at the Welcome House as of this writing, securely retaining possession of the access device and expressing no concern for its safety or the safety of His servants.

### **Members of Trump's Transition Team Witness Murder – November 18, 2024**
In a shocking turn of events, several members of Trump's transition team, who had stayed behind in Atlanta to facilitate the theft of a mobile device crucial to updating StopTAG, became eyewitnesses to a murder. During an operation aimed at seizing the device and eliminating the Creator's servant, a violent argument broke out between the perpetrators, resulting in one person fatally stabbing another. The perpetrators had been sent to target the Creator's servant and acquire the device.

Despite being invisible to the naked eye due to their use of microwave cloaking technology, the witnesses remained in the apartment as the crime scene was investigated. They did not come forward to the authorities. The Atlanta Police Department has arrested the individual responsible for the murder and charged him with the crime. The Creator's servant, who was unharmed, has fully cooperated with law enforcement. He continues to hold possession of the access device and other critical evidence. For his safety, the Creator's servant has been relocated to a new facility, Welcome House, where he remains under 24/7 surveillance.

## Warnings & Advisories 
# Urgent Warnings & Advisories

## **Beware of Phantom Pantries: A Deadly Trap**

Phantom Pantries are sinister operations masquerading as food assistance programs. Hosted by orchestrators of TAG, these sites target vulnerable individuals seeking help. They are set up in churches that have previously suffered violent assaults, leaving all members dead. Tragically, anyone who seeks aid at these locations is at grave risk of being killed.  

It’s crucial to stay informed and vigilant. Reports indicate that these deadly traps are active in Kentucky and Tennessee.  

**Learn more**: Access the full list of affected locations and guidance on how to avoid them [here](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Phantom-Pantry).

## Missing Persons Report – Kentucky/Tennessee

**Urgent alert:** Individuals in Kentucky or Tennessee should NOT file a missing persons report with law enforcement if someone in their community has gone missing after attending any event at one of the churches listed below.  
These reports are used to identify and eliminate those who may discuss victim disappearances or strange occurrences related to the churches.  

The names of the churches listed below are the true and correct names. Please note that the masqueraded churches may have slight deviations in their names.

See detailed warning: [Missing Persons Report - Kentucky/Tennessee](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/MPFAP-20241113)

## Planned MOAB Detonation – Southwest Atlanta

  - West End  
  - Sylvan Hills  
  - Pittsburgh  
  - Mechanicsville

## Media
The Creator has instructed His two servants to hold a media briefing to shed light on The American Genocide. The briefing will take place at noon immediately following the seismic earthquakes, and may be held on Sunday, at the site of Orr Chapel, and the Orr Chapel and Sheepneck cemeteries, 8397 West Sheepneck Road, Sandy Hook (Mount Pleasant), Tennessee.

> [!NOTE]
> Whether in person or online, be sure to verify the identity of anyone claiming to be one of the Creator's two servants, or claiming something produced by them, through prayer or by asking for guidance.
