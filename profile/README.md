# StopTAG: Combatting The American Genocide (TAG)

## Overview

Welcome to the StopTAG organization, dedicated to raising awareness and combating The American Genocide (TAG). TAG is a genocide. Its origins and earliest acts were driven by pharmaceutical interests attempting to prevent Spark, a revolutionary product, from reaching the public. However, since the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, TAG has been propelled by political interests. This shift is due to the nature of the attack—an illegal surprise assault on a seated congregation with the sole objective of leaving no one alive. Furthermore, killing believers in any higher power is a necessary step in establishing an authoritarian regime. Our mission is to expose these atrocities, support affected communities, and seek justice for the victims.

## Introduction

The StopTAG organization was founded in response to a series of horrific attacks on places of worship, known collectively as The American Genocide (TAG). These attacks are part of a larger effort to suppress the dissemination of Spark, a product directly from the Creator, which aims to restore human immune function and eliminate chronic diseases. Our goal is to shed light on these covert operations, prevent further violence, and support the affected communities.

## Our Mission

- **Raise Awareness**: Educate the public about TAG and its devastating impact on communities across the United States.
- **Support Victims**: Provide resources and support to victims and their families.
- **Seek Justice**: Advocate for thorough investigations and accountability for those responsible for these attacks.
- **Promote Transparency**: Encourage transparency in government and corporate actions to prevent further abuses.
- **Prevent Further Violence**: Do everything humanly possible to prevent, deter, or thwart any more contributions to the TAG death toll.

## Key Issues

1. **TAG Origins and Motivations**:
   - TAG is driven by pharmaceutical companies, particularly Gilead Sciences, to protect their financial interests from the threat posed by Spark.
   - Political figures, including former President Donald J. Trump, exploit the chaos for their agendas, aiming to shift the United States towards an authoritarian regime.

2. **Tactics Utilized in TAG-POW Attacks**:
   - High-intensity assaults and execution-style killings in places of worship.
   - Illegal body disposal methods to eliminate evidence.
   - Complex identity theft operations to obscure victims' deaths.
   - Fake religious services and community events to cover up attacks.
   - Systematic targeting of congregation members to eliminate witnesses.

3. **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)**:
   - Interception and redirection of emergency calls through covert mobile base stations (Covert Cells on Wheels).
   - Memoranda for local dispatch procedures diversion to reroute emergency responses.
   - Selective router tampering to control emergency communication channels.

4. **Notable TAG-POW Incidents**:
   - Attacks on Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, House of God (Georgetown Street and Broadway), Mount Zion Baptist Church, Calvary Baptist Church, and Hickory Valley Christian Church.
