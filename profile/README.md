> [!TIP]
> A genocide within the United States may seem unimaginable to some. In moments of doubt or disbelief, we recommend taking a quiet moment to reflect and say a prayer. Ask, "Is it true?" Seek guidance, clarity, and wisdom from the Creator. Sometimes, the answers we need are revealed when we approach with an open heart and mind.


# The American Genocide (TAG): The Revelation from the Creator's Special Mission
## About The American Genocide 
The American Genocide began as a covert and devastating campaign initiated in response to [Spark](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Spark)—a gift from the Creator  that restores the human immune system to His designed function, allowing it to eliminate any disease not caused by organ failure or dysfunction. Spark's emergence threatened pharmaceutical companies' profits, leading Gilead Sciences and the CIA to launch a brutal campaign against those associated with Spark. 

Former President Donald J. Trump was aware of the initial operations to eliminate associates of the Creator's servant and continued to be consulted about subsequent attacks. This included a series of church assaults, where congregations were targeted during their worship services. These attacks were aimed at eliminating believers, who were viewed as threats to the establishment of authoritarian rule. This hidden genocide represents a dark chapter in modern history. Explore this portal to understand the full scope and impact of TAG.

[The Creator](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator) has revealed that TAG, *The American Genocide*, is, in fact, a genocide—though hidden from plain sight. Driven by authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints, this atrocity has been growing as an undercurrent in society. The only way to end this hidden genocide is through direct intervention by the Creator. As part of [His special mission](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator#the-creators-missions), the Creator has entrusted His servants with critical information—some of which is highly sensitive or classified—to be shared with the public.

The Creator wants everyone to know that He is fully aware of the situation, and [the Apocalypse is already in progress](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Revelation). It consists of both symbolic upheavals, with literal seismic earthquakes expected to start soon. Proof of this is reflected in the [classified mission](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Presidential-Mission) involving Presidents Biden and Trump, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and CIA Director William Burns to [Phoenix House](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Phoenix-House) in Atlanta, where they oversaw repeated attempts to eliminate one of the Creator's two servants on August 29, 2024. 

By the United Nations definition, TAG meets the criteria necessary to be considered a genocide. See [TAG: By Definition, A Genocide](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/TAGDEF).

## About The Creator
The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. The Creator mentioned here is the same entity referenced in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike. [Read more.](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator)
