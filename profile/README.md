## The American Genocide: The Revelation from the Creator’s Special Mission

The Creator has revealed that TAG, *The American Genocide*, is, in fact, a genocide—though hidden from plain sight. Driven by authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints, this atrocity has been growing as an undercurrent in society. The only way to end this hidden genocide is through direct intervention by the Creator. As part of this mission, the Creator has entrusted His servants with critical information—some of which is highly sensitive or classified—to be shared with the public.

###  About TAG

The American Genocide (TAG) began in response to the introduction of Spark, a groundbreaking product designed by the Creator to restore the human immune system, combat cancer, and strengthen the cardiovascular system. Spark promised to end chronic diseases and revolutionize healthcare. The existence of Spark came to light when a routine blood test of an HIV-positive patient, Ken, showed no trace of HIV, a result confirmed by the U.S. government. This discovery alarmed pharmaceutical companies like Gilead Sciences, which saw Spark as a direct threat to their profits and initiated a covert campaign to eliminate its influence. This campaign led to targeted killings of Kelvin Williams' associates, destruction of churches, and systematic violence against communities such as Jessamine County, Kentucky; Kanawha County, West Virginia; and Maury County, Tennessee.

Attacks on churches, like Mount Calvary Baptist Church, followed by six additional churches, marked a shift from corporate interests to an authoritarian agenda driven by political elites. The acts were deemed necessary to establish an authoritarian regime in the United States with Donald J. Trump as the supreme leader. The perpetrators have engaged in continued acts of violence, using commandeered churches holding funerals and food pantries solely to kill anyone who comes.

## The American Genocide: Church Attacks

The perpetrators of The American Genocide started attacking seated congregations in churches during their weekly worship hour. Each attack follows the tactics described in "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen's book *Surprise, Kill, Vanish*, which details sudden, high-intensity assaults, execution-style killings, and the careful disposal of evidence to erase all traces of the violence. These tactics illustrate the dark capabilities of covert operations designed to silence perceived threats and obliterate evidence of their existence.

## The Creator

The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the Creator of both Life and the Universe, the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. The Creator mentioned herein is the same entity referred to in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

### The Creator's two servants

The Creator’s two servants, Currently Nameless (born Kelvin Eugene Williams) and Thomas ("TomTom") Allen Chadwell, are endowed with the same consciousness in every incarnation. They are always born on the planet where they have a mission, working anonymously to safeguard life across the universe. Known as the Cherubim in Judaism and Christianity, and as angels in other religions, their divine purpose is to execute the Creator's will with unwavering dedication, ensuring the protection and nurturing of life wherever they are needed.

## Introduction

The StopTAG organization was founded in response to a series of horrific attacks on places of worship, known collectively as The American Genocide (TAG). These attacks are part of a larger effort to suppress the dissemination of Spark, a product directly from the Creator, which aims to restore human immune function and eliminate chronic diseases. Our goal is to shed light on these covert operations, prevent further violence, and support the affected communities.

## Our Mission

- **Raise Awareness**: Educate the public about TAG and its devastating impact on communities across the United States.
- **Support Victims**: Provide resources and support to victims and their families.
- **Seek Justice**: Advocate for thorough investigations and accountability for those responsible for these attacks.
- **Promote Transparency**: Encourage transparency in government and corporate actions to prevent further abuses.
- **Prevent Further Violence**: Do everything humanly possible to prevent, deter, or thwart any more contributions to the TAG death toll.

## Key Issues

1. **TAG Origins and Motivations**:
   - TAG's origins were driven by pharmaceutical companies, particularly Gilead Sciences, to protect their financial interests from the threat posed by Spark.
   - Political figures, including former President Donald J. Trump, exploit the chaos for their agendas, aiming to shift the United States towards an authoritarian regime.

2. **Tactics Utilized in TAG-POW Attacks**:
   - High-intensity assaults and execution-style killings in places of worship.
   - Illegal body disposal methods to eliminate evidence.
   - Complex identity theft operations to obscure victims' deaths.
   - Fake religious services and community events to cover up attacks.
   - Systematic targeting of congregation members to eliminate witnesses.

3. **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)**:
   - Interception and redirection of emergency calls through covert mobile base stations (Covert Cells on Wheels).
   - Memoranda for local dispatch procedures diversion to reroute emergency responses.
   - Selective router tampering to control emergency communication channels.

4. **Notable TAG-POW Incidents**:
   - Attacks on Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, House of God (Georgetown Street and Broadway), Mount Zion Baptist Church, Calvary Baptist Church, and Hickory Valley Christian Church.

Thus, this is the work of our church.
