**Important Notice**

This advisory contains critical information regarding the TAG-POW (The American Genocide - Place of Worship) attacks, which involve a hidden genocide. We are facing ongoing interference from the CIA and federal government entities in disseminating this information effectively. We urge all law enforcement agencies receiving this advisory to ensure it reaches other agencies, particularly at the state level, to prevent interception or blockage of our information.

**Overview**

The TAG-POW attacks are a series of highly organized assaults targeting various places of worship, characterized by meticulous planning and execution reminiscent of tactics described in Annie Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish."

**Operational Details**

After each attack, all victims are reported missing. The perpetrators conduct phantom funerals, where any mourners are eliminated, and victims are kept "alive" through a phantom identity scheme. Vehicles associated with victims are swiftly removed, making it appear as though nothing has happened despite significant casualties. In these attacks, 911 services are disabled, and armed personnel block sanctuary exits, preventing escape.
