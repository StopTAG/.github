## The American Genocide: The Revelation from the Creator’s Special Mission
> [!WARNING]
> November 26, 2024 - [Phantom Pantry](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Phantom-Pantry) operations likely ongoing at Hickory Valley Christian Church (Chattanooga, TN) and Mount Zion Baptist Church (Georgetown, KY).  Anyone visiting these churches seeking assistance will be killed. 

## About The American Genocide 
The American Genocide is a covert and devastating campaign initiated in response to [Spark](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Spark)—a gift from the Creator  that restores the human immune system to His designed function, allowing it to eliminate any disease not caused by organ failure or dysfunction. Spark's emergence threatened pharmaceutical companies' profits, leading Gilead Sciences and the CIA to launch a brutal campaign against those associated with Spark.

Former President Donald J. Trump was aware of the initial operations to eliminate associates of the Creator's servant and continued to be consulted about subsequent attacks. This included a series of church assaults, where congregations were targeted during their worship services. These attacks were aimed at eliminating believers, who were viewed as threats to the establishment of authoritarian rule. This hidden genocide represents a dark chapter in modern history. Explore this portal to understand the full scope and impact of TAG.

[The Creator](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator) has revealed that TAG, *The American Genocide*, is, in fact, a genocide—though hidden from plain sight. Driven by authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints, this atrocity has been growing as an undercurrent in society. The only way to end this hidden genocide is through direct intervention by the Creator. As part of [His special mission](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator#the-creators-missions), the Creator has entrusted His servants with critical information—some of which is highly sensitive or classified—to be shared with the public.

The Creator wants everyone to know that He is fully aware of the situation, and [the Apocalypse is already in progress](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Revelation). It consists of both symbolic upheavals, with literal seismic earthquakes expected to start soon. Proof of this is reflected in the [classified mission](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Presidential-Mission) involving Presidents Biden and Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and CIA Director William Burns to [Phoenix House](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Phoenix-House) in Atlanta, where they oversaw the repeated attempts to kill one of the Creator's two servants on August 29, 2024. Some members of the delegation remained in Atlanta as of now.

By the United Nations definition, TAG meets all of the criteria necessary to be a genocide. See [TAG: By Definition, A Genocide](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/TAGDEF).

## About The Creator
The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. The Creator mentioned here is the same entity referenced in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike. [Read more.](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator)

## Latest TAG News
### **Trump in Atlanta – November 26, 2024**
Former President Donald J. Trump is back in Atlanta, where he is overseeing yet another attempt to eliminate one of the Creator's two servants and seize the access devices required to delete StopTAG and its associated GitHub repository. This operation is part of a broader effort by Trump and his allies to disrupt the Creator's intervention and halt the movement to stop The American Genocide (TAG). According to the Creator, this latest development underscores the ongoing battle to prevent the perpetrators from further advancing their authoritarian agenda.

### **Members of Trump's Transition Team Witness Murder – November 18, 2024**
In a shocking turn of events, several members of Trump's transition team, who had stayed behind in Atlanta to facilitate the theft of a mobile device crucial to updating StopTAG, became eyewitnesses to a murder. During an operation aimed at seizing the device and eliminating the Creator's servant, a violent argument broke out between the perpetrators, resulting in one person fatally stabbing another. The perpetrators had been sent to target the Creator's servant and acquire the device.

Despite being invisible to the naked eye due to their use of microwave cloaking technology, the witnesses remained in the apartment as the crime scene was investigated. They did not come forward to the authorities. The Atlanta Police Department has arrested the individual responsible for the murder and charged him with the crime. The Creator's servant, who was unharmed, has fully cooperated with law enforcement. He continues to hold possession of the access device and other critical evidence. For his safety, the Creator's servant has been relocated to a new facility, Welcome House, where he remains under 24/7 surveillance.

### **Trump in Atlanta – November 12, 2024**
On November 12, 2024, Former President and President-elect Donald J. Trump was once again in Atlanta at the Phoenix House, personally overseeing an operation to eliminate one of the Creator's two servants residing there. Trump's actions are part of a broader campaign to solidify his control and establish an authoritarian regime in the United States—an agenda that is deeply tied to the ongoing efforts of The American Genocide (TAG).

For weeks, Trump and his supporters have attempted to eliminate the Creator's servant, aiming to destroy incriminating evidence and halt his mission. However, each attempt has failed due to the Creator's protective intervention. Despite these failures, the Creator’s servant now faces severe hardship, as his sources of income have been cut off, and food assistance from Phoenix House has been drastically reduced. This move, initiated under Trump's directive, threatens the servant’s basic survival and is a direct part of the perpetrators' strategy to disrupt the Creator’s intervention.

## Warnings & Advisories 
# Urgent Warnings & Advisories

## **Beware of Phantom Pantries: A Deadly Trap**

Phantom Pantries are sinister operations masquerading as food assistance programs. Hosted by orchestrators of TAG, these sites target vulnerable individuals seeking help. They are set up in churches that have previously suffered violent assaults, leaving all members dead. Tragically, anyone who seeks aid at these locations is at grave risk of being killed.  

It’s crucial to stay informed and vigilant. Reports indicate that these deadly traps are active in Kentucky and Tennessee.  

**Learn more**: Access the full list of affected locations and guidance on how to avoid them [here](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Phantom-Pantry).

## Missing Persons Report – Kentucky/Tennessee
