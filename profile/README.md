# The American Genocide (TAG): The Revelation from the Creator's Special Mission
## About The American Genocide 
The American Genocide is a covert and devastating campaign initiated in response to [Spark](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Spark)—a gift from the Creator  that restores the human immune system to His designed function, allowing it to eliminate any disease not caused by organ failure or dysfunction. Spark's emergence threatened pharmaceutical companies' profits, leading Gilead Sciences and the CIA to launch a brutal campaign against those associated with Spark.

Former President Donald J. Trump was aware of the initial operations to eliminate associates of the Creator's servant and continued to be consulted about subsequent attacks. This included a series of church assaults, where congregations were targeted during their worship services. These attacks were aimed at eliminating believers, who were viewed as threats to the establishment of authoritarian rule. This hidden genocide represents a dark chapter in modern history. Explore this portal to understand the full scope and impact of TAG.

[The Creator](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator) has revealed that TAG, *The American Genocide*, is, in fact, a genocide—though hidden from plain sight. Driven by authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints, this atrocity has been growing as an undercurrent in society. The only way to end this hidden genocide is through direct intervention by the Creator. As part of [His special mission](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator#the-creators-missions), the Creator has entrusted His servants with critical information—some of which is highly sensitive or classified—to be shared with the public.

The Creator wants everyone to know that He is fully aware of the situation, and [the Apocalypse is already in progress](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Revelation). It consists of both symbolic upheavals, with literal seismic earthquakes expected to start soon. Proof of this is reflected in the [classified mission](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Presidential-Mission) involving Presidents Biden and Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and CIA Director William Burns to [Phoenix House](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/Phoenix-House) in Atlanta, where they oversaw the repeated attempts to kill one of the Creator's two servants on August 29, 2024. Some members of the delegation remained in Atlanta as of now.

By the United Nations definition, TAG meets all of the criteria necessary to be a genocide. See [TAG: By Definition, A Genocide](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/TAGDEF).

## About The Creator
The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. The Creator mentioned here is the same entity referenced in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike. [Read more.](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/The-Creator)

## Latest TAG News
> [!NOTE]
> Latest TAG News articles are written by one of the Creator's two servants and may include classified, secret, or closely-held private information that would have otherwise remained undisclosed. This information is provided directly by the Creator to one of His two servants for public dissemination as part of His direct intervention to stop The American Genocide. Additionally, articles may include events and details directly observed by one of the Creator's two servants.  

### The Creator and His two servants Issue Statement: There Will Be A Forever Future!
The Creator wants to assure everyone that no planet has ever gone fully extinct, and the Apocalypse is not the end of the world or time. The Creator's first creation was life, and to sustain it, He then created the universe. The Creator will always protect and nurture life on Earth, as He does throughout the universe. However, He upholds a non-interventionist policy that allows all life to make its own decisions and shape their own paths.

The purpose of the Apocalypse is to shine a light on The American Genocide (TAG) and prevent the immense loss of life that would occur if it remained hidden. Even so, the Creator is not forcing individuals to act in any particular way. It is up to humanity, particularly the American public, to ensure TAG comes to a swift end. The Creator has deployed His two servants as instruments of justice to ensure the orchestrators of TAG are held accountable. It is important to understand that His servants, born where He places them, are only human beings and require the collective efforts of humanity to end TAG and bring the "powerful" to justice.

Fear is not an option at this time. Prioritize preparedness for yourself and your family, and once safe, focus on assisting those in affected areas. The warnings and advisories issued by the Creator and His servants are meant to save lives. Let unity, courage, and action guide us through this critical moment.

### Eerie Silence Envelops Phoenix House Amid Heightened Security - Atlanta, GA
The Phoenix House was unusually quiet Saturday evening when one of the Creator’s two servants visited, a permanent supportive housing community at 1296 Murphy Avenue SW. Arriving around 6:30 p.m. to visit friends, His servant was struck by an eerie silence and the absence of usual activity. Attempts to contact his primary acquaintance, a long-time friend, went unanswered, deepening the unease.  

Phoenix House, typically a lively community, appeared nearly deserted, with few lights visible and no familiar sounds. While only one of His servant’s former neighbors was found at home, a significant Secret Service presence was observed around the property.  

The heightened security, coupled with the absence of most residents and the darkened apartments and communal areas that are normally active, raised serious concerns. His servant speculated that the Secret Service might have “wiped a third of the stars from the sky,” (Revelation 12) referencing past threats to Phoenix House. The apartment complex had previously been targeted for a MOAB detonation during His servant’s residence to eliminate him and those who interacted with him. His recent relocation to another 3Keys property, Welcome House, came after a failed orchestration directed by Presidents Trump and Biden to neutralize His servant and obtain access devices (keys) used to update StopTAG and its associated GitHub repositories. Those efforts ended when one perpetrator killed another in His servant’s apartment.  

The unsettling silence, increased surveillance, and irregular aerial activity suggested that an event of great significance might be unfolding, though its exact nature remains unclear. His servant has since attempted to contact other Phoenix House residents via phone and text message but has received no responses.  

**UPDATE: The Creator has confirmed His servant's speculations and suspicions.  The Secret Service is engaging in secret policing and eliminating the residents of Phoenix House.**

### **Trump Still Refuses to Legally Refute ANY StopTAG Reporting** - December 7, 2024
Our report delves into the critical role of President-elect Donald J. Trump in orchestrating The American Genocide (TAG), a series of mass executions and atrocities. Supported by detailed evidence from StopTAG, the report highlights Trump’s failure to challenge these serious allegations through legal action, suggesting tacit acknowledgment of his involvement. Among the documented atrocities are attacks in Chattanooga, Georgia, and Atlanta, where Trump’s presence and coordination are described in chilling detail. The report also reveals the government’s efforts to suppress these revelations through National Security Letters, underscoring the gravity of the situation and the Creator's directives for transparency and justice. To learn more about Trump’s role and the Creator's involvement, [read the full report here](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/_TrumpCD).

### StopTAG Mirrored on WordPress

### **Biden Comes to Trump's Aid in Atlanta** - December 7, 2024
President Biden made a discreet trip to Atlanta on Friday night, December 6, 2024, arriving at the Welcome House permanent supportive housing facility around 11 p.m. at the request of President-Elect Trump. This visit was part of their ongoing attempts to eliminate one of the Creator's two servants. President Biden remains in Atlanta at the time of this writing.  

The Welcome House, where one of the Creator's two servants currently resides, is a permanent supportive housing facility. His servant was relocated there following a previous orchestration that ended with one perpetrator murdering another in His servant’s apartment. In preparation for Biden’s arrival, residents of the Welcome House were removed for physical and operational security purposes. The latter ensured that no one overheard anything discussed during the operation.  

To provide coverage from an elevated point, the Secret Service utilized an Atlanta Fire Department truck stationed in the middle of Memorial Drive. During a previous visit, they used a Greyhound Bus stopped in the same location. The Secret Service also employed microwave cloaking technology, rendering their parked motorcade and personnel—including the President, President-Elect, and their protectees—nearly invisible. Interestingly, neither Biden nor Trump are utilizing the typical Suburbans or "The Beast" limousine; instead, they are using modified Mercedes-Benz Sprinters.  

Despite numerous physical attempts to harm one of the Creator’s two servants, these operations have failed. As a result, the orchestrators have intensified subconscious mind manipulation tactics in an attempt to induce physical harm indirectly. Financial restrictions remain in place, effectively implementing a “starvation protocol.”  

His servant residing at Welcome House remains steadfast and confident in the Creator's protection. While these orchestrations are an annoyance, His servant perceives no genuine threat to his life. His primary concern is the potential for new orchestrations involving Hickory Valley Christian Church, given the proximity of both Biden and Trump to the church.  

His servant has extended an invitation for direct dialogue with the orchestrators, highlighting the undeniable interventions by the Creator in these matters.  

Further updates will be shared as developments unfold.

### **Trump Returns to Atlanta** - November 30, 2024
U.S. President-Elect Donald J. Trump secretly returned to Atlanta late on Friday night, November 29, 2024, and went to the Welcome House to oversee continued efforts by both the current and incoming administrations to eliminate one or both of the Creator's servants and to obtain the access device containing credentials for updating the StopTAG organization's repositories on GitHub. This visit follows his recent trips on November 12 and 26. One of the Creator's servants, who remains unharmed and unconcerned for his safety, was relocated to the Welcome House at 234 Memorial Drive by the CIA after an earlier attempt on November 18, during which one perpetrator was killed by another inside His servant's apartment. The Creator's servant continues to reside at the Welcome House as of this writing, securely retaining possession of the access device and expressing no concern for its safety or the safety of His servants.

### **Members of Trump's Transition Team Witness Murder – November 18, 2024**
In a shocking turn of events, several members of Trump's transition team, who had stayed behind in Atlanta to facilitate the theft of a mobile device crucial to updating StopTAG, became eyewitnesses to a murder. During an operation aimed at seizing the device and eliminating the Creator's servant, a violent argument broke out between the perpetrators, resulting in one person fatally stabbing another. The perpetrators had been sent to target the Creator's servant and acquire the device.

Despite being invisible to the naked eye due to their use of microwave cloaking technology, the witnesses remained in the apartment as the crime scene was investigated. They did not come forward to the authorities. The Atlanta Police Department has arrested the individual responsible for the murder and charged him with the crime. The Creator's servant, who was unharmed, has fully cooperated with law enforcement. He continues to hold possession of the access device and other critical evidence. For his safety, the Creator's servant has been relocated to a new facility, Welcome House, where he remains under 24/7 surveillance.
