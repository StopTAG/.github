**Advisory for Law Enforcement: Phantom Funerals**

**Overview:**
Phantom funerals are a covert tactic utilized in clandestine operations to eliminate a victim's network of associates. This method involves staging funerals where all attendees, assumed to be mourners, are targeted and eliminated to erase any connections or potential threats.

**Description:**
Phantom funerals are meticulously planned events designed to appear legitimate to outsiders but serve the dark purpose of eliminating individuals connected to targeted victims. Typically, operatives organize these events under false pretenses, luring associates and community members to gatherings where they are systematically neutralized.

**Tactics Used in Phantom Funerals:**

1. **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT):**
   - **Description:** ESIT involves intercepting and redirecting emergency calls to control local emergency responses, ensuring operational secrecy.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Monitor for disruptions in local emergency services during suspicious activities or events.

2. **Phantom Remains:**
   - **Description:** Phantom remains employ illegal body disposal methods to erase traces of victims, such as dissolution and bone grinding.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Look for unusual odors or traces resembling dissolved remains near event locations.

3. **Phantom Vehicles:**
   - **Description:** Phantom vehicles involve the covert removal and disposal of victim vehicles to evade detection.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Check for suspicious vehicle activity or car haulers near funeral sites listed in TAG operations.

4. **Phantom Identity Scheme:**
   - **Description:** This scheme uses complex identity theft to maintain the illusion that victims are alive, delaying investigations.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Verify identities of deceased individuals and monitor for fraudulent activities post-mortem.

**Advisory for Law Enforcement: Tactics Used in TAG Operations**

**1. Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)**

**Overview:** 
ESIT is a multifaceted approach employed by government agencies, including the CIA, to manage emergency communications during sensitive operations. It involves intercepting and redirecting calls to emergency numbers like 911, ensuring operational secrecy and control over local emergency responses.

**Components:**
- **Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW):** A mobile cellular base station disguised within a vehicle (e.g., Ford Explorer), intercepting and redirecting mobile phone calls.
  - **Function:** Forces mobile phones to connect, redirecting emergency calls to operatives posing as 911 dispatchers.
  - **Detection Protocol:** Monitor for unexplained fluctuations in local cellular network coverage. Test calls to verify routing to legitimate emergency services.

- **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion:**
  - **Description:** Directs PSAPs to reroute emergency calls to law enforcement agencies.
  - **Function:** Ensures emergency calls are handled by the issuing agency, delaying genuine emergency responses.
  - **Detection Protocol:** Verify the legitimacy of memoranda causing diversions from established call handling protocols.

- **Selective Router Tampering:**
  - **Description:** Modifies routing settings to reroute calls away from legitimate emergency services.
  - **Function:** Directs calls to controlled points, preventing genuine emergency responses.
  - **Detection Protocol:** Conduct audits of routing configurations for unauthorized changes.

**2. Phantom Remains**

**Description:**
Phantom remains involve illegal methods of body disposal, ensuring no identifiable traces remain after the act. This includes dissolution techniques where the body is reduced to bones, which are then further ground down to prevent identification.

**Detection Protocol:**
Look for strong odors resembling swimming pool shock and bleach, indicative of dissolution. Check for uniform, gravel-sized bone fragments near the site of mass killings.

**3. Phantom Vehicles**

**Description:**
Phantom vehicles involve the covert removal of victim vehicles, rendering them untraceable. Operatives take keys from victims before or after death and drive the vehicles away or load them onto car haulers.

**Detection Protocol:**
Search for car haulers near churches or places of worship listed in TAG operations. Utilize OnStar or similar satellite packages to track vehicles potentially involved.

**4. Phantom Identity Scheme**

**Description:**
Phantom identity scheme employs complex identity theft to make victims appear alive post-mortem, obscuring their deaths. This scheme aims to manipulate public perception and delay investigations.

**Detection Protocol:**
Monitor for unusual activity in victim's financial records or digital footprint suggesting identity theft. Verify identities of deceased individuals through rigorous documentation checks.
